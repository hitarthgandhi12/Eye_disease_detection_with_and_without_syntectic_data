## 👁️✨ Eye Disease Detection Using Machine Learning & GANs 🎯🤖

The detection of eye diseases using machine learning has become a hot topic 🔥, as it opens the door to early diagnosis 🕵️‍♂️ and successful treatment 🏥. However, one major challenge is the limited availability of large and diverse datasets 📉. This is where data augmentation comes in, and specifically, GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) 🎨🤖 have proven to be a game-changer! 🎮

GANs use two neural networks—a generator 🛠️ and a discriminator 🛡️—competing with each other to produce realistic, synthetic images 🖼️. These GAN-generated images, when combined with real data, can significantly enhance the performance 📈 and generalization of machine learning models 🚀. In this project, we integrate GAN-generated images into an eye disease dataset 👁️, splitting the data as follows: 80% for training (40% real images 🖼️ + 40% GAN-generated images 🎨) and the remaining 20% for validation 📊.

By adding synthetic data 💾, we aim to boost the model’s accuracy 💯 and robustness 💪. We apply state-of-the-art models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 🧠 and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) 🔄 to classify eye diseases 👓, and we analyze the impact of GAN-augmented datasets on model performance 🎯.
